## Node.js Nginx-like Load Balancer (Built from Scratch)



## Overview

This project is a lightweight, Nginx-like reverse proxy and load balancer built from scratch using Node.js and the cluster module. It efficiently distributes incoming traffic across multiple worker processes, improving performance and reliability.

## What is Nginx?

Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server commonly used for load balancing, caching, and serving static content. It operates on an event-driven, asynchronous architecture that enables efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections.

# How Nginx Works

- Reverse Proxy: Nginx sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests and returning responses from the appropriate server.

- Load Balancing: Nginx distributes traffic across multiple backend servers to optimize performance and prevent overloading.

- Static File Serving: It efficiently serves static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without needing a separate application server.

- Security and Rate Limiting: Nginx can be configured for DDoS protection, authentication, and request rate limiting.

- Caching: It reduces server load and speeds up content delivery by caching responses.

# Features

- Load Balancing: Distributes requests across multiple workers.

- Reverse Proxy: Forwards requests to backend servers.

- High Availability: Uses Node.js cluster to handle multiple processes.

- Graceful Shutdown: Ensures proper cleanup of worker processes.

Customizable: Easily extendable for various use cases.

# Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nginx-reverse-proxy-from-scratch.git
cd nginx-node-cluster

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Usage

- Start the server with:

- node server.js

- By default, the server runs on http://localhost:3000 and distributes requests among worker processes.

# Contributing

- Feel free to submit issues, fork the project, and create pull requests. Contributions are welcome!
